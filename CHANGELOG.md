## [0.9] - 2018-09-26

### Upgrade information
#### Save format changes
The save format has been changed from version 1 to 3, that's 2 increments in one release yes.
This is due to the size of the release involving multiple new features that involved separate changes that were developed in parallel to eachother.

As always make sure to back up your old saves before converting!
To update run both `python ../scripts/convert/1_to_2.py` and `python ../scripts/convert/2_to_3.py` from within the same folder as your save files.

#### Asset changes

The way assets are stored on disk and managed in game has completely changed.  You'll no longer be able to manage your assets from your file manager or command line, and will have to use the in-browser tools to work with them.  This is a change that was required in order to provide extra features to the assets while preserving disk space. (e.g. personal assets / share assets / default templates / ... )
Assets are now stored in `/static/assets/` instead of `/static/img/assets/`.  In order to keep your current saves working (if they have assets that rely on the old image locations), the old folder is kept intact and will not be removed.  You are free to do with this folder as you please as it is no longer used by PA itself.

### Added
- Added a note system
- Initiative tracker update
    - Now shows the active actor and has a next turn button

        - Works when used from the draw tool in reveal/hide mode
        - Does not properly work in normal mode on the fow layer!
        - In general: Use it to draw on non-fog layers or use it in reveal/hide mode
- [tech] tools onSelect and onDeselect for more finegrained tweaking and UI helpers
- Option for players to select the colour of their rulers.

    - e.g. an aura that used to be 20/60 should now be 20/40
- [tech] Most UI is now rendered using the reactive Vue.js framework instead of JQuery

### Fixed

- Ownership changes are now reflected in the initiative list
- Dim value aura's had the wrong radius
