**IMPORTANT: READ THIS FIRST**

This version is part 2 of a 2 part upgrade process of the save file.
A completely new and different save format is going to be used in the future

## 0.10.0

**IMPORTANT: READ THIS FIRST**

This version is part 1 of a 2 part upgrade process of the save file.
A completely new and different save format is going to be used in the future
and this requires a drastic change once, _(which is now)_

In this first part a script is added to convert an existing save file to the new format. Once this conversion is done, you should continue with part 2 which is the next release.

THIS RELEASE WILL ON PURPOSE NOT RUN CORRECTLY TO MAKE SURE THE UPGRADE PROCESS IS FOLLOWED AS EXPECTED.

**You have a save that you wish to convert**

Make sure you are in the "PlanarAlly" folder containing the "planarserver.py" file. (If you are in a PlanarAlly folder with another PlanarAlly subfolder, you need to open the subfolder).

Run the script `python ../scripts/convert/database.py <save_file>`.
(if save_file is ommited, the default save file location "planar.save" is used)

If all is well this should generate a `planar.sqlite` file.

**You have no existing save or don't care about your save**

You can completely skip this release and go straight ahead to the next release.

**END IMPORTANT**

Aside of the major save file changes, some other things are present in this release cycle.

### Added

-   Option to choose save file location [contributed by Schemen]
    -   The server config now has an option to specify a different save file name and/or location.
-   Dockerfile [contributed by Schemen]
    -   A dockerfile is now present to support deployment in docker containers
-   VERSION file in the python folder
    -   This will be used in the future to detect software updates

### Fixed

-   Unable to drag modal dialogs in Firefox
-   Unable to drag assets in Asset Manager in Firefox
-   Empty asset and note list was to small for icons
-   Tools started with lowercase
-   Radial menu buttons had border when clicking them

## [0.9] - 2018-09-26

### Upgrade information

#### Save format changes

The save format has been changed from version 1 to 3, that's 2 increments in one release yes.
This is due to the size of the release involving multiple new features that involved separate changes that were developed in parallel to eachother.

As always make sure to back up your old saves before converting!
To update run both `python ../scripts/convert/1_to_2.py` and `python ../scripts/convert/2_to_3.py` from within the same folder as your save files.

#### Asset changes

The way assets are stored on disk and managed in game has completely changed. You'll no longer be able to manage your assets from your file manager or command line, and will have to use the in-browser tools to work with them. This is a change that was required in order to provide extra features to the assets while preserving disk space. (e.g. personal assets / share assets / default templates / ... )
Assets are now stored in `/static/assets/` instead of `/static/img/assets/`. In order to keep your current saves working (if they have assets that rely on the old image locations), the old folder is kept intact and will not be removed. You are free to do with this folder as you please as it is no longer used by PA itself.

    -   Chromium based browsers had slight improvements but already were (ans still are) much more performant in regards to FOW calculation
-   Shapes that do not have an associated image, now show their name or token tag in the initiative dialog

## [0.4] - 2018-05-04

The great bugfix release

### Added

-   Bring players here function in the rightclick menu when nothing is selected
    -   This will bring over all players to the exact same pan and zoom settings as the DM
    -   Only the DM can access this

### Fixed

-   Grid size DM UI works again. It broke in 0.3
-   Cutoff zoom at 0.01 instead of 0, as zoom factors of 1e-16 caused issues with pages crashing
-   Adding a new location did not correctly send some options to the client
-   The annotation field in the edit asset dialog now prevents key presses to propagate to the board (e.g. no longer deleting shapes because you pressed delete in the textfield)
-   The selection box now is smaller for very small assets
-   Slowdown on the opening of the edit asset dialog throughout gameplay has been fixed.
-   Location options not synced immediately
-   Quick tracker/aura edits now work again

## [0.3] - 2018-04-19

### Added

-   Shape selection option is added to the draw tool, currently giving the option between a rectangle and a circle.
-   More camera options
    -   Use the arrow keys to move 1 grid unit in the pressed direction
    -   Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out
    -   Press the middle mouse button to pan without using the dedicated pan tool
-   Quickly create simple circular text tokens
    -   right click anywhere that is not an active selection and select the 'create basic token' option
    -   You can insert any text and choose the fill and border colours
    -   Although singular letters or numbers work great, any text will be scaled to fit inside the circle, so longer texts can also work.

### Changed

-   Line width of shape borders increased to 5

### Fixed

-   Various initiative issues with locations

## [0.2] - 2018-04-11

This update is firstmost an update in regards to the development process so little to no new feautures are added in this release.
A couple of important bugfixes are included though.

### Added

-   A save file version is added to the save to possibly convert older saves in the future.
-   A barebones annotation system for shapes
    -   You can add text to any asset using the edit asset dialog
    -   Whenever you mouse-over a shape you own the text will appear at top of the screen
    -   This is mostly a DM tool but players can use it as well.

### Fixed

-   Websocket protocol now correctly chosen at the client side, this caused players to just see a blank scene in some situations
-   Players on a different IP as the dm now actually see images.
-   Pan and zoom options are now remembered per user AND location instead of only per user.
-   MovementObstruction and visionObstruction were not immediately synced on toggle.
-   Groupselect now behaves more predictable when one member collides with a movement blocker

### Changed

-   Move from 1 large javascript file to a proper multi file typescript system
-   When dragging an asset against a movement blocker, it will smoothly slide across the blocker instead of completely locking up.

## [0.1] - 2018-03-22

### Added

-   Initiative tracker
    -   Right click on any asset and add it to the tracker.
    -   Options to hide initiative of certain assets
    -   The initiative of an asset will be removed on delete
        -   this can be disabled with the 'group' flag. This is very handy for minions with the same initiative.
-   Every 5 minutes a save will be written to disk as an extra persistent layer.
    -   saves already happend on other occasions.

### Fixed

-   The delete key no longer removes selected assets if used in an input field!
