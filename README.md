# PlanarAlly

_This project is still in active development; multiple bugs or structure changes can and will happen_

A companion tool for when you travel into the planes.

PlanarAlly is a web tool that adds virtual battlemaps with various extras to your D&D toolbox.

Some key features are:

**Self hosting**: You can run this software wherever you like without having to rely on an external service\
**Offline support**: This tool can be used in a completely offline set-up for when you play D&D in a dark dungeon.

**Simple layers**: Organize your scenes in layers for easier management.\
**Infinite canvas**: When a limited workspace is still not enough!\
**Dynamic lighting**: Increase your immersion by working with light and shadows.\
**Player vision**: Limit vision to what your token(s) can see. Is your companion in a different room, no light for you!\
**Initiative tracker**: Simple initiative tracker

This tool is provided free to use and is open source.
