# client

The Planar Ally client is a typescript codebase setup using vue-cli. When you want to run the client you'll need to have a Planar Ally server running as well.

## Setup

### Installation of depencencies

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

This requires the server to be ran in development mode as well.

```
npm run serve
```

If both server and client are running you can launch PA by visiting http://localhost:8000

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```
