# Logic Systems

The logic systems are small things that can be added to a shape to modify its behaviour.

There are two flavours that exist right now: Doors and TeleportZones.

## Doors

Door logic makes it easier for the DM, and if allowed players, to quickly open/close doors.
Without the door logic attached, a shape has to either manually be moved or its blocking properties need to be toggled manually.

With door logic, a player with permissions (configurable per door) will see their cursor change when hovering a door in play mode.
Simply left-clicking will then toggle the blocking properties of the shape.

## TeleportZones

Teleport zones allow transfer of shapes from the teleport zone shape to a target that is configurable.

Zones can be configured to act immediately upon entering or not, in which case there is a UI element to active the teleport zone.

Eligible teleport zone targets are spawn locations. So make sure to create those.
