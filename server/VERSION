2025.1.1

### Added

-   Draw tool:
    -   Added default colours for walls, windows, doors
    -   These get automatically applied when the relevant vision/logic settings are enabled in the draw tool
    -   Can be disabled by unchecking the 'prefer default colours' checkbox in the draw tool vision settings
    -   The specific colours used can be configured in the user options Appearance section and will update shapes retroactively
-   Notes:
    -   Notes can now be popped out to a separate window
-   NoteManager:
    -   Added a button to clear the current search
-   In-Game Assets UI:
    -   Option to search through assets
    -   Option to add folder shortcuts per campaign
        -   These allow quicker navigation to frequently used folders
        -   A "All assets" shortcut is always available
-   [server] Assets:
    -   limits:
        -   Added limits to the total size of assets a user can upload and the size of a single asset
        -   These limits can be configured in the server config
        -   By default there are no limits, it's up to the server admin to configure them
        -   These limits will only apply to new assets, existing assets are not affected
    -   Thumbnails:
        -   The server will now generate thumbnails for all assets

### Changed

-   Dashboard:
    -   Changed some border colours in the create new game menu
-   MenuBar:
    -   Add Notes button for players
-   [tech] Select tool:
    -   Delayed syncing of selection state to the global state from mouse down to mouse move/up
    -   This fixes some of the entries in the Fixed section
-   AssetManager:
    -   Changed UI of renaming assets, allowing inline editing rather than opening a popup
    -   The images shown in the asset manager will now use the thumbnail of the asset if available
        -   This should reduce load times and improve general performance
        -   This also applies to the preview when hovering over assets in the in-game assets sidebar
    -   Remove initiated from the context menu now removes the entire selection
    -   Context menu retains selection unless an item not in the current selection is clicked
-   In-game assets:
    -   Sidebar is removed and replaced with a new Assets dialog similar to notes
    -   The new UI has almost full compatibility with the assets in the dashboard
-   Notes:
    -   Add filtering option 'All' to note manager to show both global and local notes
    -   Note popouts for clients without edit access now show 'view source' instead of 'edit'
-   Dice tool:
    -   Last result is now displayed in the dice tool rather than a popup window
    -   Result breakdowns are shown in the last result display and history
    -   Added a reroll button to quickly redo the previous roll
    -   Added a reroll button to history entries
    -   Add an option to roll 3D dice inside a dice box rather than over the playfield
    -   Input field now scrolls to the end after populating via the on screen buttons
-   @planarally/dice:
    -   (this is the standalone dice library that handles most of the dice logic and rendering)
    -   Upgraded to v0.7
    -   Dice will now stop sliding smoother
    -   Clear state can be configured
    -   D100 dice now properly work in 3D for the full range (1-100 / 0-99)
        -   Currently hardcoded to 1-100 in the client, but the library can be told otherwise
-   I18n:
    -   Added 95% i18n for zh (except diceTool)
-   [server] Assets:
    -   Assets are no longer stored in a flat folder structure, but instead use a subpath based structure
        -   An asset with hash `35eaef2e9a116aa152f7f161f1281411cb1e1375` is now stored as `assets/35/ea/35eaef2e9a116aa152f7f161f1281411cb1e1375`
-   [tech] Systems: Move system-core from game/ to core/ so that it can also be used by e.g. assets

### Removed

-   Labels:
    -   As mentioned in the last 2 releases these were going to be removed
    -   I wasn't happy with the current implementation and they were causing more confusion than they were useful
    -   This also removes the Filter Tool
-   .paa asset handling
    -   This was no longer really maintained and the current frontend doesn't offer any support for it

### Fixed

-   Notes:
    -   It was possible to open a 'view-only' note on a tab you weren't supposed to see
    -   Note manager could be empty and unusable when changing locations or losing view access to an open note
    -   Search filter not resetting page to 1 potentially causing a blank page if on an other page
    -   Default edit access on notes was not correctly applied
    -   Fix searchbar overlapping over other modals
    -   Global notes no longer have a default access level
    -   Notes can no longer be locally edited by clients without edit access through the note popouts
-   Shape Properties:
    -   Input changes could not persist or save on the wrong shape if selection focus was changed while editing (see selection changes)
-   Modals
    -   Dragging modals (e.g. notes) now also brings them to the foreground as if clicked
-   Composites:
    -   Moving composites to a different location could sometimes lead to errors on the client even though the moves were succesful serverside
-   Select Tool:
    -   Snapping an existing shape point to some other point could be overriden with a snap to the grid
-   Game Listing:
    -   Clicking on a session that shares a name with another session would foldout both
