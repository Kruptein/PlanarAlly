2024.3

### Added

-   Optional simple chat system
    -   This is **not** stored serverside, so messages will be lost on refresh or later re-opening of the session
    -   Chat is basic markdown aware, but does not allow direct HTML
    -   (image) urls can be pasted without special markdown syntax
    -   Can be collapsed by clicking on the chat title
-   Collapse Selection: Temporarily move all shapes in the selection under the cursor for easier navigation through corridors
-   [DM] new DM settings section: Features
    -   Can be used to enable/disable certain features campaign wide
    -   Currently limited to chat & dice

### Changed

-   Select tool:
    -   now integrates all the ruler toggles in its UI as well
    -   these toggles are synced with the ones in the ruler
-   Spell tool:
    -   now renders hexes instead of squares in Hex grid mode
    -   step size changed to 1 in Hex grid mode
    -   shape bar is no longer visible, only hex is available in hex grid mode for now
-   Ruler tool:
    -   now defaults to sharing with other users
-   Dice
    -   non-3D mode
    -   option to use a click interface to build dice strings
    -   extra operators and selectors (e.g. keep highest 2)
    -   3D code & assets are only loaded when settin "use 3D" to true in the tool config for the first time
    -   3D physics now uses havok engine instead of ammo (babylonjs upgraded from 4 to 7)
    -   history & result UI slightly changed
    -   Option to share result with nobody
    -   clicking on the notification of another player's roll shows the details
    -   clicking on a history entry shows the details
-   Toolbar UI
    -   All extended tool UI is now right aligned fully, no longer hovering over the related tool
    -   This was preventing tools to the left to be limited in screen estate they could occupy

### Fixed

-   Draw tool:
    -   Clicking on the "blocks movement" label in the draw tool's vision setting now properly toggles the related checkbox
-   Ruler tool:
    -   Gridmode spacebar did not synchronize snapped end correctly to other players
