2023.1.0

### Added

-   Button to change the current asset for a shape to the shape property settings
-   [DM] Quick access togglebar under the tool bar
    -   Fake Player
    -   Initiative active state (see below)
-   Initiative now has a specific "active" state
    -   This streamlines some things and allows some further future things without relying on the initiative window being open
    -   The Initiative vision lock setting now only triggers when initiative is active
    -   The above setting now also properly reverts to the original vision lock when initiative is no longer active as was always intended
    -   The initiative UI is automatically opened for everybody once initiative is started. (and automatically closed as well)
    -   The above behaviour can be disabled by a new user setting.
    -   A new DM setting (under Varia) can be enabled to limit (non-DM) initiated movement only to the active initiative shape.
-   Most modals will now move to the front when interacted with
-   Most modals can be closed with escape

### Changed

-   Spell tool
    -   range property is removed as it was confusing to people and a bit fiddly
    -   a ruler is now automatically drawn between the spell shape and the selected shape
-   Dice tool: Add min-height in dice tool UI where the dice to roll are being prepared
-   [lang] The edit dialog for shapes now properly says "Edit shape" instead of "Edit asset"

### Fixed

-   Spell tool: spell on selection bugged
-   Spell tool: fill colour behaving janky when border colour has <1 opacity
-   Spell tool: right-click was opening the context-menu
-   Spell tool: once used, the select tool was not being properly activated
-   Spell tool: the 'is public' label was wrongly attached to the range input box
-   Fake Player: showing DM layer
-   DM settings: Fix last DM being able to demote themselves to a player
-   DM settings: Fix invite URL not containing subpath if set
-   Assets: default stroke colour wrongly set, causing badges to be transparent
-   Trackers: Display on token not working for trackers that are shared across variants
-   Some cases where a client could edit shape info without access
    -   _this was always rejected by the server and never synced_
    -   most tracker properties
    -   defeated and locked state using keybinds
-   Prompt modals sometimes still using a validation check from an earlier prompt
-   Resizing the botright corner of a rectangle-based shape while rotated was moving the shape
-   Token direction UI triggering when other UI is on top of it
-   Floor detail UI not moving along if side menu is opened
-   Unlocking shape could sometimes trigger the shape following your mouse
-   Templates: only using the first character of the provided template name
-   Asset Manager: close contextmenu when scrolling
-   Asset Manager: contextmenu appearing in the wrong location when scrolled
-   Adding multiple shapes to group always prompting group question even if no groups are present
