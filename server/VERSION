2024.2

### Added

-   New grid section in Edit Shape dialog
    -   Configure manual size for shape
        -   Used for finetuning snapping behaviour
    -   Show grid cells the shape occupies
    -   Configure hex orientation
        -   This is used to determine which orientation even-sized shapes should use in hex grids
-   Client Setting "Grid Mode Label Format" to decide what the ruler should show in grid mode
    -   This can be set to either '#cells only', 'distance only' or 'both'
-   Import: option to specify the name for the imported campaign

### Changed

-   Export/Import:
    -   Error toasts no longer have a timeout
    -   (Shape)Labels are no longer exported/imported
-   Ruler tool: allows Unit Size less than 1.0
-   Context menus have been restyled
-   [tech] Select tool: only take shapes in view into account
-   [tech] Properties System can now handle multiple shapes loaded at once

### Fixed

-   Draw Tool:
    -   snapping mode was also snapping to the point being moved
    -   now also snaps to hex vertices
    -   the first mouse press now also properly snaps to the grid
    -   fix small point changes when flipping the rectangle axis while drawing
-   Select Tool:
    -   resizing in snapping mode was also snapping to the point being resized
    -   polygon edit UI had a small visual glitch on appearance causing a circle to appear around (0, 0)
    -   Snap to Grid:
        -   This now has an implementation for hex grids
        -   This should now more properly snap shapes that are larger than 1x1
-   Ruler Tool:
    -   Snap now properly works for hex grids
-   Map Tool:
    -   Now better supports hex grids
-   Spell tool:
    -   selecting another tool would swap to the Select tool instead
    -   Change 'Size' input box to allow entering numbers less than 1 easily
-   Polygon:
    -   selection/contains check went wrong if a polygon used the same point multiple times
    -   selection/contains check was also hitting on the line between the first and last points when not closed
-   Moving shapes to front/back not updating immediately
-   Export:
    -   Missing Character, DataBlock and new Note data
    -   Fixed note data migration crashing due to new format
-   Import:
    -   Prevent a potential timing edgecase causing import to run twice
    -   If an import fails, the newly created (faulty) room will be removed
-   Notes:
    -   The filter was not properly rerunning when opening shape notes, causing notes from the previous shape to still be visible sometimes
    -   When shape filtering, the shape name in the UI would change if you clicked on another shape with the select tool.
    -   Note icons drawn on a shape could be drawn behind the shape in some circumstances.
    -   Fix 'add shape' and 'remove shape' events not being synced immediately if you only have view access
    -   Note icon on shape was drawn in strange locations for shapes larger than 1x1
    -   Fix shape removal not properly removing the shape from related notes client-side
    -   Fix notes not being stored in shape templates
-   Groups:
    -   The 'edit shape' groups tab was completely broken, this has been resolved
    -   Multiple things in the groups tab have become more responsive to changes
        -   Everything badge related is now updating as it happens
        -   Members will now appear/disappear immediately
-   Initiative:
    -   Fixed an issue where Initiative.Order.Change would fail when called with some Shape Ids.
-   Annotations:
    -   Fixed rendering of markdown which included raw HTML elements.
-   Changing client settings for the grid would not immediately update the screen
-   [tech] FloorSystem's layers properties are now only reactive on the array level and are raw for the actual elements.
