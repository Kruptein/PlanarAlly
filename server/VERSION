2025.3.0

### Added

-   Admin panel that can be accessed from the dashboard
    -   Currently limited to the main admin_user as configured in the server's config
    -   Shows roughly same content as the original separate admin client
    -   Also shows total number of users/campaigns and a quick user create button
    -   Last login day for users
-   Toggle to search through shared assets
    -   This is heavier for the server and niche so not enabled by default

### Changed

-   Smoothed out the scroll zoom behaviour when zoomed in furthest
-   [server] Config values that are not known will now error and stop the server from starting
-   [tech] Add debounce to asset search

### Removed

-   [server] Legacy server configs
-   [server] Admin server - this is replaced with a new in-client admin dashboard

### Fixed

-   Ensure stat export is chunked to prevent rejection from stat server
-   Rapid (dis)connect sequences flooding the stats
-   Don't re-open shape properties after a re-select
-   Last grid-line in X or Y axis sometimes not rendering
-   Deleting first initiative entry would enter invalid state
-   Going to previous initiative would decrement effect timers
-   Going to previous initiative could enter negative rounds
-   Render bug in vision mode "behind" showing the entire shape under certain circumstances
-   Asset search server query had a missing () causing assets from other users to show up
-   Floor renaming the wrong entry
